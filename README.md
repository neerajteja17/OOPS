# C++ OOP Concepts with Examples
This repository contains C++ programs demonstrating the four main Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

# üìå Concepts Covered
Encapsulation - Restricting direct access to data and providing controlled access via methods.
Inheritance - Reusing code by deriving new classes from existing ones.
Polymorphism - Methods that behave differently based on the object.
Abstraction - Hiding implementation details and providing only necessary functionalities.
üìÇ Code Examples

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation
Encapsulation ensures that data is hidden and only accessible through public methods.

Example 1: Basic Encapsulation
Example 2: Getter and Setter Methods

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

Example 1: Single Inheritance
Example 2: Multiple Inheritance

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows different classes to have methods with the same name but different behavior.

Example 1: Function Overloading
Example 2: Function Overriding

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Abstraction
Abstraction provides an interface without exposing implementation details.

Example 1: Abstract Class with Pure Virtual Function
Example 2: Interface Implementation

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation & Inheritance Combined
A program demonstrating both encapsulation and inheritance.

# üöÄ How to Run the Code
Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
Compile the code using the command:
g++ program_name.cpp -o output

# Run the executable:
./output

Feel free to contribute, fork, or raise issues! Happy coding! üòä
